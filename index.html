        <h2>Having trouble?</h2>

        <p>We get it. Sometimes parts break down. Back in the old days we could 
        easily repair mechanical parts without having to worry about the electronic 
        components.</br>

        Not anymore.</br>

        Because all of our devices and ships (and in some cases extremeties) require 
        a more technical touch, you need someone who knows cybernetics in and out.</p>

          <p>Excellent service. An entire service station impressively handled by only
          one man and several robots that he has self-constructed. Performed mecahnical 
          repairs and electronic re-wirings of the <strong>FX 10-82</strong>. 
          Performed all repairs within two days, and topped the tank for no extra charge. 
          Jupiter is a quickjump from Earth, so we plan on revisiting for any other 
          repairs.</p>

          <p>With a station this close to Earth, it's hard to remain unnoticed. WarVDine, 
          however, took great liberties in ensuring my safety. I only have a small transport
          ship that he took into a secure chamber and repaired after an hour. 
          The GPS was not working correctly, but he also found and repaired internal 
          wiring that improved the ships warp thrusters.</p>
          
          <p>I asked and he said he does not perform repairs away from his station.</p>

          <p>horrible service his bots were nice but he was never around, my arm was repaired
          but cost was high and he was more focused on the robot parts than my safety. I 
          was shocked twice and he apologized but i am worried as this is my first 
          cybernetic limb i dont want to get hurt. BE CAREFUL!!!</p>
